## Branching Strategy
This project follows the **GitFlow Workflow** for code versioning:
- The *master* branch must be stable at all times, storing completed releases
- The *develop* branch is the main branch to develop on, when a release is completed, *develop* must be merged into *master*
- A significant feature must occur on a new branch, branched from develop and merged back into develop when completed
